This is the Linux/desktop PC version of the KIM Uno simulator.

It's just the hack I use for expanding and debugging the KIM Uno. It is thus Ugly Code, always in a state of transition. But maybe it adds to someone else's fun.


Compiling
* Requires ncurses.
* Note that you need to set ../kimuno/config.h target to PERSONAL_COMPUTER!
* running make clean, make should then compile the KIM executable for you

Special functions:
- built-in debugger utility: press F1. F2 continues normal running
- by editing the source (kimuno.c) and recompiling, you can set breakpoints
- ctrl-Y: exit

Read the web site how-to, on how to operate the KIM Uno. And press F1 for help.


The 6502 programmable calculator:
This mode is not implemented in the PC version.
