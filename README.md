# Code Monkey KIM
This is a fork of KIM UNO project by Oscar Vermeulen,<br>
see original docs here: https://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/kim-uno-summary-c1uuh<br>
The only change I made is replaced the support for original keypad and LED segments<br>
by the custom hardware I had - 16x2 LCD shield and 4x4 key keypad.<br>
Current setup lacks SST switch and PC button, otherwise it has the same functionality<br>
as original KIM UNO.
